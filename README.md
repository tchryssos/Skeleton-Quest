# Skeleton-Quest
Skeleton Quest is a traditional text-based CLI adventure game.

Players will create a character and enter a spooky dungeon to fight skeletons in an effort to end a rising global skeleton threat.

Both character and enemy stats are semi-randomly generated along statlines dictated by their classes. In other words, a Knight will (almost always) have a lot of strength, and a Wizard will (almost always) have a lot of wisdom. Skeletons have classes as well.

Stats determine how effective attacks are, as well as their chance to hit.

If the player can defeat the SKELETON LORD at the end of the dungeon they will end the skeleton menace. Players will have to defeat the SKELETON LORD's minions in order to find him.

Combat, character generation, and loot drops utilize table-top RPG mechanics, with the game rolling "dice" in the background, which means every character, battle, and dungeon will play out a little bit differently!
